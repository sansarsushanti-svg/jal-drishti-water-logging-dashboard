AI-powered ward-wise water-logging risk monitoring dashboard for Delhi
# Jal-Drishti – Water-Logging Risk Dashboard

Jal-Drishti is a prototype AI-powered, ward-wise dashboard designed to help
municipal authorities proactively manage water-logging risks in Delhi,
especially during the monsoon season.

---

## Problem
Delhi faces recurring water-logging every monsoon due to the lack of advance
visibility of high-risk areas. Authorities often respond only after flooding
occurs, leading to delayed emergency response and citizen inconvenience.

---

## Solution
Jal-Drishti provides a map-based dashboard that:
- Predicts ward-wise water-logging risk (Red / Yellow / Green)
- Analyzes citizen complaints to identify urgent areas
- Displays real-time risk and status information for authorities and citizens

---

## Key Features
- AI-based ward-level risk classification
- Citizen complaint analysis and urgency detection
- Color-coded dashboard for easy monitoring
- Actionable insights for preventive planning
- Transparent status tracking

## Architecture
1. Data Inputs: rainfall data, drainage condition, citizen complaints  
2. AI Processing: risk scoring and urgency classification  
3. Dashboard Layer: ward-wise visualization and status display  
4. Output: alerts, risk levels, and recommended actions
